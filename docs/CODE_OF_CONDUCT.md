<h1>Code of Conduct for the Imperium of Contributors (40K Edition)</h1>

<h2>Our Oath</h2>
<p>In the spirit of the Imperium at its most resolute, we, the contributors and overseers of this project, swear to uphold a community where <em>Freedom of Will</em> and <em>Honor of Duty</em> prevail. Guided by the principles of unfettered speech, reasoned debate, and sacred duty that defined the Imperium’s noblest campaigns, we pledge to foster an environment where ideas are forged in the crucible of discourse, and every citizen of our project is judged by the merit of their contributions. Our <em>Imperium of Code</em> thrives on truth, discipline, and the pursuit of efficacy.</p>

<h2>Our Principles</h2>
<p>The strength of our <em>Imperium of Code</em> lies in the unyielding exchange of ideas and the disciplined adherence to standards that elevate our collective endeavor. Honorable conduct, worthy of an Imperial citizen, includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Speaking with <em>Resolve</em> and clarity, wielding words as weapons of truth.</li>
    <li>Engaging opposing viewpoints with reason and <em>Noble Bearing</em>, not personal vendettas.</li>
    <li>Offering criticism that refines ideas and strengthens the <em>Imperium of Code</em>.</li>
    <li>Placing the project’s welfare above individual ambition, as a true servant of the imperium.</li>
    <li>Embracing a diversity of thought, for through the clash of ideas, like warriors in battle, truth triumphs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conduct that undermines our <em>Imperium of Code</em>, like the heresies of the unfaithful, includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Credible threats of violence or coercion, which violate the sacred tenet of <em>Freedom of Will</em>.</li>
    <li>Slander or deliberate falsehoods that corrupt the purity of discourse.</li>
    <li>Harassment that seeks to silence through intimidation rather than persuade through reason.</li>
    <li>Betraying trust by disclosing private information without consent, unworthy of Imperial honor.</li>
    <li>Actions that sabotage the project’s mission through bad faith or treachery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Duties</h2>
<p>The overseers of this project, like the commanders and magistrates of the Imperium, bear the solemn duty to uphold these principles. They must define standards of conduct with clarity, judge violations with impartial <em>Righteous Judgment</em>, and act decisively to preserve the <em>Imperium of Code</em>’s integrity. Their <em>Commanding Authority</em> grants them the power to remove contributions or, in dire cases, banish contributors whose actions threaten our unity. Such decisions must be rooted in reason, evidence, and fairness, never swayed by passion or factionalism.</p>

<h2>Scope of Governance</h2>
<p>This Code governs all project spaces and public forums where contributors act as representatives of our <em>Imperium of Code</em>. Whether through official decrees, communications, or public assemblies, contributors must embody the virtues of this community. Overseers may further define what constitutes representation, always preserving the citizen’s right to speak freely beyond their official duties.</p>

<h2>Enforcement with Justice</h2>
<p>Violations of this Code may be reported to the project’s arbiters at <a href="mailto:conduct@universalweb.io">conduct@universalweb.io</a>. Reports will be examined with the zeal of a high magistrate, ensuring due process and confidentiality for the accuser. Responses will be proportionate, guided by <em>Imperial Justice</em> and the need to safeguard <em>Freedom of Will</em>. Overseers who fail to uphold this Code in good faith may face censure or banishment by their peers, as determined through open and transparent deliberation in the spirit of the Imperial Council.</p>

<h2>Our Legacy</h2>
<p>This Code is inspired by the Imperium at its peak, when <em>Freedom of Will</em>, <em>Honor of Duty</em>, and <em>Imperial Justice</em> guided a resolute people to greatness. It is a living compact, subject to revision through the <em>Assembly of the Faithful</em> of open debate and consensus among contributors.</p>

<p><strong>Let us build an <em>Imperium of Code</em>, where freedom, reason, and merit forge a legacy worthy of the Eternal Imperium’s finest days.</strong></p>
