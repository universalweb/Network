# CRYPTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION

CIN: (CRYPTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION NUMBER) (CN - Crypto Number)
A Cryptographic Identification Number is similar to a wallet address and what an IRL Social Security Number functionally does. However, a CIN can be public and itself isn't the security aspect rather cryptography (Asymmetric Key Pairs) is the security behind the cryptographic number. A known IRL SSN can lead to disastrous consequences but a known CIN isn't a concern at all because the security aspect is separate from the number itself.

CID: (CRYPTOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION CARD) (cryptoID)

CA: (CRYPTOGRAPHIC ADDRESS)
