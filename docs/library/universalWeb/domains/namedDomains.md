#NAMED DOMAINS (Namespace) & NAMED DOMAINS AS THE EXTENSION

A Namespace (ex: uw://NAME) is a versatile domain that serves as your standalone domain name and can be a custom extension for creating additional domains under your control. 
A Named Domain or a Namespace can be your main address or used as an extension to build other sites with it, like uw://NAME uw://shop.NAME
This provides significant benefits for larger networks, brand names, trademarks, brand marketing, and carving out our your own section of the Universal Web.
