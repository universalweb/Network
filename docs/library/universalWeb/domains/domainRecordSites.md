# DOMAIN RECORD APP [DRA] (DIS Apps)

[AKA Domain Certificate Apps, Domain Record Website]
Domain record sites are sites that exist partially or fully within a DIS certificate.
Websites, Apps, and or games can be stored in a BINARY FORMAT, SCRIPT, MARKDOWN, UTF8, HTML or other formats.
The BINARY FORMAT would require a specific structured object. The object can store resources, app logic, and specific instructions.
This approach eliminates the need to host a website separately, allowing reliance on the Domain Information System (an evolution of DNS).
Domain certificates are cached and can use checksums to verify if a new version is available.
Using VIAT as a distributed decentralized storage mechanism along with the DIS means on-chain apps can be fast and efficient.
Due to the security of the DIS and domain certificates (that are first self-signed) users can operate on the highest possible guarantee.
This helps to eliminate global bandwidth.
The UW comes with commonly used resources such as design libraries, icons, and JS libraries meaning DRAs can include them with no additional cost.
