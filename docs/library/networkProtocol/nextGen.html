<h1>Next Gen Connection Establishment</h1>
<h4>An Evolution of DNS & Handshake Protocol</h4>
<p>Modern Domains, Domain Name System, Domain Certificates, and UDP based Network Protocol enables next gen connection establishment. Domain ertificates are structured in CBOR and include a long-term key exchange key pair and a long-term signature key pair. Domain certs are mandatory self-signed to ensure the contents remain secure from the point of creation. In addition to the self-sign a centralized or decentralized CA is enforced to ensure a verifiable chain of trust. Domain certs can pre-include the unique 64 byte hash of a parent CA certificate that will be used to verify the chain of trust which ensures that the parent CA is a trusted parent. Domain certs act as a single unified authentication source ensuring the highest level of trust not offered by the WWW. Domain certs include DNS related records offering the highest level of trust for DNS related requests while remaining more efficient. Once you have a domain certificate you have immediate access to all possible publicly acceptable DNS records for a particular domain. Private Domain Certificates are still possible but are not recommended for typical domains which is more for enterprise and government usage for the highest level of security and privacy for publicly accessible servers.</p>
