# Directed Acyclic Mesh || Directed Acyclic Meta Graph || MDAG (DRAFT NAME)

high throughput and low latency - SPEED & SECURITY AT ALL COSTS

multi-layered interdimensional structure: The DAG differentiates between types of blocks—independent transaction blocks and various verification/snapshot/link blocks—forming distinct layers or tiers. SMART Contracts operate on different layers giving the Meta Graph interdimensional properties.
Heterogeneous Nodes: The blocks are not uniform; they serve different functions (e.g., transactions vs. verification), meaning the graph comprises heterogeneous node types.
Hyper connected: The DAG has extreme levels of interconnection.

## General View

Transactions are independent blocks which can be independently verified during the mining (verification) process via verification nodes.
Several different types of blocks are then used to verify, snapshot, and or link blocks together to form a directed graph.

This model supports high throughput and independent verification, aligning well with next-generation cryptocurrency designs that aim for scalability and real-time processing.

## NAVIGATION GRAPH

A Navigation graph is a dedicated navigational layer consisting of navigation nodes designed to efficiently traverse the Webway (The layers which physically create the DAG).

A relay uses warp Tunnels (the path itself) to quickly navigate to different nodes. This requires a programmatic structure to efficiently traverse making search & find queries cheap and fast. Efficient navigation of warp space.
