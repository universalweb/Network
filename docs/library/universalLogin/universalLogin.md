# Universal Login

Offer two security levels low and high. Low is a sort of KDF using a master key pair and high is random key pair for the site. For high if you lose that specific key you lose the login credentials thus the specific credentials and or seed must be saved, which takes up more disk space. Low means you can at any time generate that specific key pair using your original key pair / seed, which means potentially only one seed would need to be stored. This should be left up to either the user and or the application to decide. Some applications may enforce the low security option as a way to have a sort of offline password recovery/reset option and fast logins/signups. This design must also be built into the UW:// protocol itself to enable easy, safe, automatic, and or one click Universal logins/signups. Precautions should be taken and security concerns understood with automatic login and signup feature if enabled.
