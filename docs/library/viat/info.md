# VIAT INFO

<!-- TODO -->
Viat is a hybrid post quantum cryptocurrency
Viat has a physical on-disk file system which forms a super structure.
Viat's super structure represents the total state of Viat.
Viat has a modular file system so that it can be effectively distributed throughout a network.
Viat's super structure is a cryptographically linked DAG with the first block being the genesis block which then connects to a primary secondary level.
Viat's secondary level consists of the first blocks of specific DAGs such as a Wallet Genesis Block, L2 token genesis block, and Verification Genesis block.
Viat's secondary level genesis blocks are the beginning of DAGs specific to that genesis block.

Viat prioritizes scalability, look-up speed, and transactions per second.
Viat is designed to create a linear relationship between TPS and network resources.
Viat's super structure is neuromorphic, self-organizing, layered, multidimensional, and is DAG-Like.
