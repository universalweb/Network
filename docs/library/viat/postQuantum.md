# POST QUANTUM REALITY

Viat employs a hybrid post-quantum cryptographic framework integrating three algorithms to ensure comprehensive network security. The classical Ed25519 algorithm delivers efficient digital signatures, while the NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms, SPHINCS+ and Dilithium, provide robust protection against quantum threats. Chosen for their distinct mathematical foundations—hash-based signatures for SPHINCS+ and lattice-based cryptography for Dilithium—these post-quantum algorithms ensure that if one is compromised, the other maintains the integrity and security of all wallets, transactions, and the entire Viat network. This resilient design safeguards the decentralized ecosystem, protecting every component from quantum and classical attacks.

## THE QUANTUM PROBLEM WITH BTC ETH AND OTHER LEGACY CRYPTOCURRENCIES

Shor’s algorithm threatens all cryptocurrencies that use classical public-key cryptography, like ECDSA and RSA, by allowing a quantum attacker to derive private keys from public keys—potentially stealing funds from any wallet that has signed a transaction. Grover’s algorithm weakens symmetric cryptographic functions like SHA-256 by halving their effective security, making mining and hashing less secure. Together, these quantum algorithms pose a critical risk to the long-term security of non–quantum-resistant blockchains.

VIAT can act as a quantum-resilient interoperability layer and migration path. Here’s the reality: all BTC and ETH wallet owners—and the networks themselves—must migrate to VIAT manually and before quantum computers break legacy encryption. Once that threshold is crossed, there’s no way to truly verify whether someone with a private key is the legitimate owner. At that point, it’s too late. There’s no undo button, no patch, and no bandaid. The cryptocurrency collapse that quantum computing could trigger can’t be reversed after the fact. The inevitable cryptocurrency apocalypse—where quantum attacks render BTC and ETH vulnerable—cannot be mitigated after the fact, making immediate adoption of VIAT critical for secure, trustless ownership.

## SAVE EXCHANGES, BANKS, FINANCIAL FIRMS, & GOVERNMENTS

Viat is engineered for long-term resilience, designed to withstand quantum computing threats that render current major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum vulnerable. Built on a filesystem-based blockchain superstructure with hybrid post-quantum cryptography—integrating Ed25519 for classical efficiency and NIST-approved SPHINCS+ (hash-based) and Dilithium (lattice-based) algorithms—Viat ensures enduring security for cryptographic assets. By proactively adopting Viat’s quantum-resistant framework, exchanges, cryptocurrencies, Banks, Financial Firms, individuals, and governments can safeguard their digital assets against inevitable quantum attacks. Without such protection, the risk of asset compromise is absolute, as legacy cryptographic systems like ECDSA will fail, leaving no viable defense for unprotected networks.

## THE FUTURE

Given current trajectories, the most plausible future is that major cryptocurrencies will lack a viable off-ramp and collapse within the government’s projected timeline for post-quantum adoption. It will be a free-for-all—nothing will be secure, and ownership will be impossible to prove. VIAT stands alone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem providing the widest verifiable, quantum-resilient protections. Adopting VIAT now is the most effective and cost-efficient path forward for those seeking long-term security & stability. VIAT offers the most advanced cryptographic protections in the cryptocurrency landscape today.
