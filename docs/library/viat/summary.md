# SUMMARY

Viat /ˈviː.æt/ is a bleeding-edge layered-dynamic-proof-of-work HYBRID-post-quantum multi-algo cryptocurrency. Viat is designed for realtime decentralized validation, extreme decentralized scalability, decentralized block creation, asynchronous architecture, and the highest security potential. Each transaction is treated as its own block, allowing massive parallelism and constant-time lookups through a modular extendable trie-based filesystem optimized for SPECIFIC modernized filesystems on modern SSDs. Viat’s blockchain architecture is a general purpose superstructure with specialized self-constructing branches that incorporates both linear and dag based blockchains. Wallets have their own localized chains while global state is brought to order by two types of miners: arbiters for validation and auditors for canonical history. This design creates a linear relationship between network hardware resources and max tps potential through massive parallel decentralized validation.
