# SUMMARY

VIAT is a next-generation cryptocurrency purpose-built for the post-quantum era, combining cutting-edge cryptography, massive parallelization, and a self-organizing filesystem architecture to deliver extreme scalability and speed without sacrificing decentralization. At its core, VIAT uses a hybrid signature model—Ed25519 + Dilithium—for every transaction, with SPHINCS+ available as a failsafe, ensuring long-term verifiability even under quantum computing threats. Its key exchange also leverages a hybrid of X25519 and Kyber, offering authenticated, encrypted communication with forward secrecy and post-quantum resistance.

Unlike traditional blockchains, VIAT structures its data as a file-backed self-organizing superstructure, where each transaction exists in its own independent block and is physically stored on disk using a Trie-based folder hierarchy. This design guarantees near constant-time (O(1)) lookup and retrieval, enabling millions of transactions to be validated, inserted, or audited in parallel. Blocks are mapped to a physical path determined by their type and cryptographic hash, allowing distributed, resumable syncing.

The network is powered by two classes of miners: Arbiters, who verify and confirm individual transactions, and Auditors, who validate and optimize entire segments of the block superstructure while providing cryptographic proofs for system-wide consistency. This architecture supports efficient light clients, offline transaction verification, and powerful fraud detection without the need to traverse an entire blockchain history.

VIAT is natively integrated with the Universal Web (UW), a post-HTTP web platform featuring a custom UDP-based protocol (UDSP) and a quantum-secure DNS replacement (DIS). The DIS provides signed, encrypted domain certificates with integrated key exchange and authentication, eliminating the need for traditional CAs and improving web security and identity verification.

With support for massive scalability, quantum-resistant cryptography, decentralized identity, offline verification, and future-proofed sidechain expansion, VIAT is not just a cryptocurrency—it's a foundational infrastructure for a secure, high-performance digital economy.

## OVERVIEW

VIAT is a next-generation cryptocurrency engineered for the highest possible transaction throughput, leveraging post-quantum cryptography and a novel, self-organizing file-based superstructure. Every transaction exists as its own independent block, stored physically on disk using a hierarchical multi-Trie-based filesystem, allowing near-instant (O(1)) lookup, verification, and syncing. This architecture enables massive parallelism—millions of transactions can be processed simultaneously with minimal overhead—while offering post-quantum security through hybrid signature schemes (Ed25519 + Dilithium with SPHINCS+ fallback) and hybrid key exchange (X25519 + Kyber). Unlike traditional chains, VIAT’s blocks are deterministically organized by their content, making all data placement predictable, scalable, and fast, even across distributed networks. Combined with native support for offline verification, resumable syncing, and decentralized identity, VIAT is built to be the fastest, most secure, and most future-proof infrastructure in the cryptocurrency space.
