# OWNERSHIP

Entities that first generated a key pair owns the associated wallet unless legally transferred to another entity. This helps to provide a legal framework & fair process for entities to recover stolen assets. However, there are exceptions to this noted below.

## TREASURE

Dead wallets which are NOT attached to a forwarding contract (A legal contract that passes key pairs to new specified owners) are part of the PUBLIC TREASURE. Wallets part of the Public Treasure can be legally accessed via guess work and or brute forcing the generation of the controlling key pairs. This ensures that VIAT & cryptographic assets can re-enter circulation within a fair legal framework. A proper public notification process must occur in-order for wallets to be marked as part of the public treasure & can be brute forced.

## STOLEN WALLET

Various methods ensure it's effectively impossible to steal VIAT.

The primary safeguard against theft lies in using hybrid multi-cryptographic algorithms to generate a single, unified key pair. This unified key pair combines multiple cryptographic algorithms to provide both classical and post-quantum security while leveraging a variety of mathematical principles for stronger protection. Employing diverse mathematical foundations increases the complexity needed to compromise a wallet, particularly if one of those foundations is broken or becomes solvable. The unified key pair is cryptographically linked to the wallet address. Address generation is programmatic, ensuring that anyone can transparently generate the wallet address to verify its linkage to the unified public key.

## PROXY WALLETS

Wallets which do not have any restrictions and or act as linked clearing houses for payments. 
This strategy is primarily used for creating a setup with a cryptographic enclave wallet linked to a proxy wallet designed to make payments and or send assets. The proxy wallet is cryptographically linked to the primary wallet. The proxy wallet is more of a forwarding address that can then send out assets to other addresses. In the event of a compromised primary wallet the proxy wallet is the only wallet that can receive assets sent from it.
