# VIAT NEUROMORPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

	- The Trie structure mirrors the hierarchical branching of neurons and dendrites, where lookup paths resemble synaptic pathways leading to specific neurons. Neurons and their dendrites exhibit a hierarchical branching pattern, where the primary branch (the one closest to the cell body) gives rise to secondary branches, which in turn can give rise to tertiary branches, and so on, forming a tree-like structure. This hierarchical structure plays a crucial role in neuronal function, particularly in integrating information from multiple sources and in shaping the receptive field of the neuron
	- The multiple DAGs/Linear Blockchains behave like interconnected subnetworks in the brain, each responsible for different functional pathways (e.g., wallet DAG, transaction chain, receipt DAG).
	- Each DAG/Chain is self-contained yet contributes to the larger cognitive flow of the system — like specialized brain regions.

Parallelism and Asynchronous Processing
Just like the brain, Viat supports massively parallel verification and processing.
Nodes (verifiers/validators) act like neurons firing and validating inputs in parallel — no global synchronization is required, reflecting asynchronous neural signaling.

Spatially Addressable Memory (On-Disk Trie Folders)
The physical filesystem structure mirrors spatial locality in the brain, where data is organized and located efficiently.
The use of constant-time lookups via physical paths is like neural signals traveling along optimized, reinforced synaptic paths.

Viat's block centric design with specialized structures allows VIAT to benefit and more easily integrate a native neural network and or model that can be used to carry out complex queries with great efficiency.

A new block is essentially a new memory introduced to the neuronal state of Viat (The Superstructure). This memory is now part of Viat's short term memory which overtime can either be strengthened by the network and or effectively "forgotten". Strengthening a block "memory" is done overtime becoming more certain and effectively committed to long term memory what we can consider to be confirmed on traditional blockchain networks.

Viat filesystem
These types of URLs serve as a memory map linking to a specific memory location which stores the block(memory). That memory then branches out to related memories.

For example this memory map (URI) is a folder path that leads first to a specific part of the brain that is the Viat Superstructure. In this case the specific part deals with wallets.

The URI act as a pathway or memory index to a specific memory. As you travel down the pathway associated information can be accessed until the final location.
