## TREASURE

Dead wallets which don't indicated long-term storage and or have active secondary/backup wallets can be considered part of the PUBLIC TREASURE. Wallets part of the Public Treasure can be legally accessed via guess work and or brute forcing the generation of the controlling key pairs. This ensures that VIAT & cryptographic assets can re-enter circulation within a fair legal framework. A proper public notification process must occur in-order for wallets to be marked as part of the public treasure & can be brute forced.
