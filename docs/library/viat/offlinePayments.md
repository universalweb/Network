# VIAT AS IN-PERSON DEBIT CARD OR CREDIT CARD

Due to VIAT's inherent nature it makes it ideal for in-person payments which are technically likely online anyway.
Regardless a client that is synced up enough to the network could generate a valid proof block which represents a valid transaction and receipt. Combined with the efficient real-time capabilities of Viat this makes VIAT ideal for in-person on-the-spot payment events.
