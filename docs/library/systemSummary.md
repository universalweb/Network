# SYSTEM SUMMARY & OVERVIEW

What we call The Nexus is a post quantum Meta-Layer solution with a hybrid network architecture designed to be a multi-planetary information system. It serves as the foundation for a next-generation Web with a natively integrated cryptocurrency, and federated governance. It's a vast system with many components.

The Nexus consists of two primary networks: the first is The Universal Web (Web) and the other is VIAT (Cryptocurrency).

## DOMAIN SYSTEM

The Nexus doesn't use DNS instead it uses the Domain Information System which offers a more robust feature set with significantly higher security & transparency.
The DIS is a more advanced solution to DNS and is fundamentally different.
A DIS query returns a cryptographic certificate that is self-signed in addition to 3rd party signature verification.
The returned certificate contains the relevant records used to navigate the network.
A DNS query returns a domain record, but the DIS returns a cryptographic certificate.
In the legacy Web the end service returns a certificate not DNS but in the UW the certificate was from the initial DIS query.
Although it's provided by the DIS servers can still allow requests for the certificate from clients.
