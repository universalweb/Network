# Anonymous unique identity

All UW Profiles/Viat Wallets are encrypted went sent to a service and the public key is never used to establish connections or ever sent over in plaintext to initiate a keyexchange. This keeps all UW Profiles completely hidden from observers. They're anonymous & serve as a way to authenticate and or login to services.
