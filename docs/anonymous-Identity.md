# Anonymous unique identity

All identity certificates are encrypted within the first packet and the public key is never used to establish connections or ever sent over in plaintext to initiate a keyexchange.
This keeps all identity certificates completely hidden from observers. They're anonymous & serve as a way to authenticate and or login to services.
