# UW:// & Universal Data Stream Protocol security

UW:// First acquires a domain certificate which it requests from the Domain Information System. The connection to the DIS is encrypted using pre-provided certificates. The root pre-provided certificates help clients to verify and connect to a DIS server. The DIS is a distributed decentralized network designed for certificate distribution. Certificates rely on blockchain technology and to a degree a certificate authority to establish trust. UDSP has Perfect forward secrecy. Domain Certificate can be fine tuned for their own balance of performance & security.

## UW:// Security Compared to HTTP

UW:// is encrypted by default & offers options for far greater encryption, privacy, and anonymity than HTTP/s while remaining as performant as possible. UW:// enforces the latest standards in encryption and is not designed for nor does it permit older encryption schemes such as RSA.
UW doesn't rely on another layer to handle the encryption process like HTTP with TLS. All the magic happens within a single layer as to be as performant yet secure as possible.
